Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work
on those files among multiple people.
It is primarily used for source code management in software development but it can be
used to keep track of changes in any set of files.
As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for
distributed, non-linear workflows
